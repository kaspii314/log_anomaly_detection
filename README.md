In todayâ€™s digital age, cybersecurity has become a primary concern for business. While threats come in many forms, compromised credentials continue to be a main cause of costly breaches. It is essential that harmful user activity is identified and dealt with as quickly as possible, and this has become a fundamental capability of many cyber protection solutions. In this paper, we research whether we can identify anomalous user activity in massive computer (host) log files. Using Isolation Forest, we show that not only can we identify potentially compromised users, but we can do so with highly irregular and limited training data.
